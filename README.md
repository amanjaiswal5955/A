# BIM (3D, 4D, & 5D) analysis of G+2 Office Building (steel framed) 

1. About: 
Main objective of this project is to Built the concepts of Building information modelling (BIM) and applying all the concepts of 
BIM such as 3D Modelling in Revit, 4D Planning and Scheduling in Primavera P6 & MS Project, 5D Cost & Quantity estimation, 
6D Working towards Sustainability, 7D Facility management of projects. 
* In this project I worked on 3D, 4D & still working on 5D analysis of G+2 office building. 
* This project is built with the help of software such as Autodesk Revit, Microsoft project, Microsoft Excel, Autodesk 
Navisworks. 
* Autodesk Revit is used to crate a 3D model of G+2 office building project. 
* Microsoft Project is used for Planning and Scheduling of Activities and Task. 
* Microsoft Excel is used to connect my MS Project Data to Navisworks environment. 
* Autodesk Navisworks is used to Simulate the model with Scheduled timeline and help in analyzing the delays. Also we 
can perform cost estimation, Quantity takes off and for measurements. 
Project Data such as Sheets, sections, Animated videos, MS Projects report, excel sheet, Navisworks file (.nwd) and Revit 
file (.rvt).
